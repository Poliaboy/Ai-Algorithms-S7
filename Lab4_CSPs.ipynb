    "The [OR-Tools (Operations Research Tools)](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver?hl=en) library developed by Google is a powerful toolkit for solving combinatorial optimization problems, including Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). OR-Tools features the CP-SAT solver — a constraint programming solver powered by a SAT solver backend. This solver typically outperforms traditional CSP solvers in speed and capability, handling larger and more intricate problems with greater efficiency. It accommodates an extensive array of [constraints](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/python/sat/python/cp_model), such as all-different, linear, and scheduling constraints, making it a versatile choice for complex industry-grade and research problems."

Each course needs to be scheduled in a particular room at a certain time, and no two courses can be in the same room at the same time. Additionally, some courses have prerequisites, meaning they must be scheduled earlier in the day than the courses that require them.\n",

    "\n",
    "    * Five courses need to be scheduled: ['Math', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'Computer Science'].\n",
    "    * Three rooms are available for scheduling: ['Room A', 'Room B', 'Room C'].\n",
    "    * There are 4 time slots available: ['9 AM', '11 AM', '2 PM', '4 PM'].\n",
    "    * Specific courses have prerequisite requirements:\n",
    "        - 'Physics' can only be scheduled if 'Math' is scheduled earlier in the day.\n",
    "        - 'Biology' must be after 'Chemistry'.\n",
